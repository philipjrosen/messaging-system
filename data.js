And when the tinsmiths came, bringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired, \"Can you straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him back into shape again, and solder him together where he is broken?\" The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever.  So they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into his old form, and his joints worked as well as ever.  To be sure, there were several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as the Woodman was not a vain man he did",

You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very good breakfast.\" \"Don't!  Please don't,\" begged the Tin Woodman.  \"I should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.\" But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no one ever knew what it was, for he didn't mention it.  And the Scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so that she would not be hungry for a long time. ",

Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the houses, and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps. And overhead the dawn was growing brighter, clear and steady and calm. He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and up and down stairs behind him.  His landlady came to the door, loosely wrapped in dressing gown and shawl; her husband followed ejaculating.

It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface must have begun its course.  The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin.  It has air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence. Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to the very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that intelligent life",

The detective passed down the quay, and rapidly made his way to the consul's office, where he was at once admitted to the presence of that official. \"Consul,\" said he, without preamble, \"I have strong reasons for believing that my man is a passenger on the Mongolia.\" And he narrated what had just passed concerning the passport. \"Well, Mr. Fix,\" replied the consul, \"I shall not be sorry to see the rascal's face; but perhaps he won't come here&mdash;that is, if he is the person you suppose him to be.",

Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents. \"That's his hump.

In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies.
